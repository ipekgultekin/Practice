#  Bed&Breakfast Booking Management System
This project involves the development of BASIC, a command-line application for managing users, properties, and bookings. The primary aim was to create a comprehensive system that streamlines the management process.
Through this Java project, I enhanced my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as class design, encapsulation, and the relationships between objects. This experience has strengthened my programming skills and prepared me for future software development challenges.
